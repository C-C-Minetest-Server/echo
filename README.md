# Echo

This mod provides a better and unified interface for handling in-game notifications. All notifications are stored across server restarts and are accessible anytime until the user deletes them.

This mod's name comes from MediaWiki's notification extension, [Echo](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Echo). Many concepts were taken from that extension, though no code is used.

For developer's manual, see API.md.
